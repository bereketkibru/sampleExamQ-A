## QUESTION 70
You are modifying a blog site to improve search engine readability.
You need to group relevant page content together to maximize search engine readability.
Which tag should you use?
1. `<article>`
2. `<span>`
3. `<tbody>`
4. `<cd>`
## Answer A
## Explanation
   The `<article>` tag allows to mark separate entries in an online publication, such as a blog or a magazine. It is expected that when articles are marked with the `<article>` tag, this will make the HTML code cleaner because it will reduce the need to use `<div>` tags. Also, probably search engines will put more weight on the text inside the `<article>` tag as compared to the contents on the other parts of the page.
  
  The `<article>` element specifies independent, self-contained content.

An article should make sense on its own, and it should be possible to distribute it independently from the rest of the web site.

> Examples of where an `<article>` element can be used:

* Forum post
* Blog post
* Newspaper article
___
